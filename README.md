This texture pack was created by GridExpert and edited by Arbiter-289.
It is designed for Minecraft version 1.21.1 and is compatible with Sodium and Oftifine.
The icon.png image was inspired by the icon from the Glowing texture pack, created by 7777777_4547 and Alfa Leoli. Additionally, the orichalcum_ore texture from the Many More Ores and Crafts mod by Graclyxz was used.
